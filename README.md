You need a ESP8266 control board in order to use this firmware.

You can make a simple PCB like this,

I just make one as below,

and installed in my robot.  You can also add the OLED and MPU6050 via the I2C bus, and connect a touch sensor to GPIO-13.

Or if you cannot make the PCB yourself, you can buy a ready to use control board from Taobo.
